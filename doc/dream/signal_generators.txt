The signal generators are embedded in time t->t+1
    Rotations of groups -> signal (deterministic)
    Markov model -> emmitted signal (stochastic)
        Transformational grammar
        Meta markov:
            stay in 1 w high p, modulate to 5, return.
            Assign sonnatal grammar, recover other grammars from other music styles
            Parts of musical speech

    User input -> signal (stochastic)
    Chaotic system -> signal (quasi-stochastic)

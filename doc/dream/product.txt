The end product should be portable to an Arduino
    via e.g., hArduino and the Adafruit "Wave Shield"
    and a MIDI shield so that an end user can hook:

    ARDUINO ---- MIDI ---- Human
       |                    |
      AMP-------INSTRUMENT--|
       |
    MUSIC OUT
    
    Using various pre-loaded example collective configurations
    editable {\em a priori} on a computer for live shows.

    Alternatively:

    MIDI---COMPUTER---AUDIO OUT
     |      |            |
     \---Human------INSTRUMENT

    To use, I imagine a human setting up a basic config,
    setting it to "go", perhaps some livecoding goes on,
    then interface via midi and play alongside with
    a real instrument.

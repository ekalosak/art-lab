# art-lab

This package will eventually contain the monads required for
    Steve Riech & Phillip Glass inspiried art creation.
    That is, rules bound only by the progression of time
    into the future as defined by musical progression,
    video movement, and left-to-right reading of texts will
    be arbitrarily (deterministic or stochastic or a mix)
    plug-and-playable, mix-and-matchable for a universal
    art creation package. The category of rule-based
    art creation objects is a monoid under the time
    progression morphism.

While this is a project meant to make the use of functional
    programming paradigm, I will use an imperative/OO
    language to describe the components of the system.

OBJECTS:
1. Collective: the set of artists, outlets, and parameters
    used to describe the composition of subobjects and their
    interactions.
2. Outlet: renders digital representations to physical
    analog actions e.g., a WAV file to sound. This is
    the most IO, system, hardware oriented object.
3. 

ARROWS:
1. Time morphism: Collective@t -> Collective@t+1

INSPIRATION:
Philip Glass's "Metamorphosis" and "Symphony 2",
Steve Riech's "Electric Counterpoint",
Rothko's entire portfolio,
Lorenz's waterweel and strange attractors,
Category theory e.g., Goodwillie calculus and
    Dmitry Vagner's work,

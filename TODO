DREAM PRODUCT
The end product should be portable to an Arduino
    via e.g., hArduino and the Adafruit "Wave Shield"
    and a MIDI shield so that an end user can hook:

    ARDUINO ---- MIDI ---- Human
       |                    |
      AMP-------INSTRUMENT--|
       |
    MUSIC OUT
    
    Using various pre-loaded example collective configurations
    editable {\em a priori} on a computer for live shows.

    Guitar pedal: http://www.electrosmash.com/pedalshield

    Alternatively:

    MIDI---COMPUTER---AUDIO OUT
     |      |            |
     \---Human------INSTRUMENT

    To use, I imagine a human setting up a basic config,
    setting it to "go", perhaps some livecoding goes on,
    then interface via midi and play alongside with
    a real instrument.

EFFECTS
    Sample rate (bitcrushing)
    Scale-setting (i.e., scale1=['bf1','c2','ef2',...])
    Distortion
    Panning

INSTRUMENTS
    Synth
    Drums
    Samples

ARTWORK
    Particle simulation in a field

RULES
    RULE GENERATORS
        Metarules for creating collectives, artists,
        rules, instruments, etc. kinda like the C=CAT
    SIGNAL GENERATORS/PROCESSORS
        Rotations of groups modulo primes
        States of chaotic systems
        Markov models
        User input
        Neural nets / rand forests / other ML
        Weather, etc.
        Abstract mathematical objects and morphisms

USER INPUT
    User input can be grabbed and processed by an artist.

PACKAGES (3rd party)
    AUDIO
        midi: reading and writing of MIDI, no sending/receiving
        hmidi: MIDI interface, sending/receiving
        hcodec: has a MIDI codec
        Haskore: used for analyzing, composing, and
        manipulating music.
        HasChorus: High level overlay for haskore
        hmp3: mp3 player
